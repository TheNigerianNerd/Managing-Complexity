# Managing-Complexity
A collection of projects exploring pragmatic software engineering â€” from basic data types to advanced algorithms, design patterns, and system design. This repo serves as both a study journal and a playground, turning theory into hands-on practice with clear, practical examples. The focus is on building real engineering intuition.
